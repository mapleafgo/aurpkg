# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  schedule:
  - cron: "0 */3 * * *"
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
